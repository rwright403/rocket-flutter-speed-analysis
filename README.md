# rocket-flutter-speed-analysis üöÄ
A losely coupled flutter speed calculator built using open-source and software available to students (from a student license).

## Required Program Inputs:
### CFD - from Openfoam:
The following files:
- p
- rho
- Ma - or a ??? #TODO:
- U

### Structual Model - from ALTAIR HYPERMESH NASTRAN:
- natural frequencies
- mode shapes


## Running this program:



> python3 -m 



# documentation

## Project Goal:
Given a supersonic rocket with chosen fin dimensions, solve the divergence and flutter speed

## UVic Rocketry Anduril-2 Information:
1) Dimensions:

   Fuselage outer diameter: 5.75 in
   Total rocket length: 97.64 in
   Span: 5 in
   Root chord: 13 in
   Tip chord: 3.5 in
   Sweep distance: 8.5 in
   Fin thickness: 0.255 in
   Fin count: 4
   

L/D ratio: 12?

Fin shape:
Trapezoidal profile w/ hexagonal airfoil


Fin attachment to fuselage/boat tail:
Loctite EA E-120-HP Epoxy

2) Flight Profile:

Velocity



## Workflow Notes

Initially tried to use NASTRAN:
- MSC NASTRAN did not have flutter accessible in the student version
- Altair Hypermesh (NASTRAN) did not have supersonic aero

Therefore we need to work at a lower level: 
New approach "weakly coupled solver" - using [5] as a guide.
This method requires Harmonics and a CFD Simulation

   ## Harmonics Simulation
   - Altair Student edition is easy for me to obtain as a student. It is the least restrictive and NASTRAN files are easy to parse.

   ## CFD Simulation
   - OpenFOAM, see [8],[9],[10]

   ### My toolkit docker setup:
   |-home
      |-rocket-cfd
         |-openfoam-data
         |-openfoam-dockerfiles

   Running the docker container:
   > sudo docker container run -ti --rm -v $HOME/rocket-cfd-toolkit/openfoam-data:/data -w /data openfoam:latest


   ## Flutter Sol:
   This repository
   -Copy results files from Harmonics and CFD Simulations into the correct dir <!-- TODO: DEFINE -->


Using a virtual environment to stop this from interfering w other python projects:
Enter virtual env with 
> source venv/bin/activate
Exit with - deactivate







## Structural Modelüóº

### Fuselage and Nosecone 
???
modeled as rigid - aluminum tube

### Fin 
is being loaded in:
- Out of plane bending
- Torision
- Shear

Assuming small deformations (linear) to start

## Interpolation ‚û∞

## Other Assumptions and Notes üìù
- want to recreate experimental data to validate our understanding/methods
- likely want to do a mesh convergence study on model
- temperature effects?

## Solver üìù

## Postprocessing Tools üõ†Ô∏èüêç



## Validation ‚úÖ

See [4]

Potentially See [3] - seems to use piston theory

[1] also has examples
TODO: try first tutorial to build an understanding of how all the pieces fit together
