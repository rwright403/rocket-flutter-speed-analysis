# rocket-flutter-speed-analysis üöÄ

## Project Goal:
Given a supersonic rocket with chosen fin dimensions, solve the divergence and flutter speed

## UVic Rocketry Anduril-2 Information:
1) Dimensions:

   Fuselage outer diameter: 5.75 in
   Total rocket length: 97.64 in
   Span: 5 in
   Root chord: 13 in
   Tip chord: 3.5 in
   Sweep distance: 8.5 in
   Fin thickness: 0.255 in
   Fin count: 4
   

L/D ratio: 12?

Fin shape:
Trapezoidal profile w/ hexagonal airfoil


Fin attachment to fuselage/boat tail:
Loctite EA E-120-HP Epoxy

2) Flight Profile:

Velocity



## Workflow Notes

Initially tried to use NASTRAN:
- MSC NASTRAN did not have flutter accessible in the student version
- Altair Hypermesh (NASTRAN) did not have supersonic aero

Therefore we need to work at a lower level: New approach to use existing aero and structural models and create our own solver.

_old
1) Start with flight path and fin geometry from flight sim / analysis
2) Build Structural/aero model
3) Run a SOL 103 


## Structural Modelüóº

### Fuselage and Nosecone 
???
modeled as rigid - aluminum tube

### Fin 
is being loaded in:
- Out of plane bending
- Torision
- Shear

Assuming small deformations (linear) to start




## Mass Model ‚öñÔ∏è

Gmsh???

## Aerodynamic Model ‚úàÔ∏è

Using USU Aerolab MachLine: https://github.com/usuaero/MachLine


## Splines ‚û∞



## Other Assumptions and Notes üìù
- want to recreate experimental data to validate our understanding/methods
- likely want to do a mesh convergence study on model
- temperature effects?

## Solver üìù


https://fenicsproject.org/ 


## Postprocessing Tools üõ†Ô∏èüêç



## Validation ‚úÖ

See [4]

Potentially See [3] - seems to use piston theory, ZONA51 is more complicated
This case does not include body shockwaves

[1] also has examples
TODO: try first tutorial to build an understanding of how all the pieces fit together
