               Welcome to MSC Nastran 2024.1
  
   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions in several releases through the year. Key enhancements in
   Version 2024.1 are summarized below. Addtional details can be found in
   the MSC Nastran Version 2024.1 Release Guide.
  
     MSC Nastran 2024.1 Features and Enhancements
  
     High Performance Computing
     - Reduced runtime for linear statics with large number of load cases,
       particularly when MAXMIN is requested (PARAM,PRTMAXIM)
     - New DOMAINSOLVER option: STATRED
       - Uses Automatic Multi-level Static Reduction to compute A-set
         (boundary) static reduction
       - Available for External Superelements and External Modules in
         static analysis
     - MUMPS solver out-of-core capability available for large models
     - MUMPS solver DMP capability integrated into Lanczos - both normal modes
       and buckling
     - Faster Coupled Modes method
       - Available in SOLs 103, 111 and 200
       - Also available for External Superelement analysis
  
     High Performance SOL 400 (NLPERF)
     - MUMPS solver added with both SMP and DMP parallel scalability
     - SMP scalability up to 32 threads
     - New Convergence monitor for job monitoring during analysis
     - Contact support enabled with the Arc-Length Method
  
     Rotordynamics
     - SOL 128 post processing improvements to output iterative outputs for
       displacements and nonlinear load in CSV format. Provide outputs for
       selected frequencies of interest.
  
     HDF5 Module output control
     - Module model data and results may be optionally appended to an existing
       HDF5 file for results grouping
     - MDSET Case Control command provides a means to select specific modules
       for data recovery when there are duplicate element or grid IDs across
       modules
  
     NVH
     - Single-step Transfer Path Analysis (TPA) in SOL 111 for Simplified
       Estimation and Ranking of Noise and Vibration contributions via the
       different Transmission Paths in a Structure or Structure-Cavity System
     - Reduced disk space requirements and faster solution time for models
       with poroelastic materials (PEM)
1    - PEAKOUT capability extended for Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP) at
       peak frequencies.
     - Modeling of glue lines in linear solutions using cohesive elements
  
     ADAMS MNF Enhancement
     - Fluid modes at acoustic grids can now be included in the MNF to
       facilitate the recovery of acoustic pressure directly in Adams
     - Rotordynamic effects can now be included in the MNF to allow Adams to
       capture rotordynamic effects

 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 4425 (PRTPRN)
     ONE OR MORE FATAL ERRORS HAVE OCCURRED.  THERE MAY BE MORE ERROR MESSAGES IN THE PRECEDING OUTPUT
     User information:
     One or more modules has found a fatal error condition.  A message is
     printed for each fatal error condition.  They have set a flag, which
     causes this message to be printed at the end of the run.  Error messages
     may occur anywhere in the output, so you should search your output for
     these errors (search for FATAL).
  
     This message is most likely when PARAM,ERROR,0 is used.  However,
     this error will be issued in superelement analysis if User Warning
     Message 4698 is also issued.
  
     In cyclic symmetry analysis, if no eigenvalues are found in the
     prescribed frequency range on the EIGR or EIGRL entry for the current
     harmonic, the run will not continue to the next harmonic and the message
     will result.  Instead of selecting a frequency range, input the desired
     number of modes.
