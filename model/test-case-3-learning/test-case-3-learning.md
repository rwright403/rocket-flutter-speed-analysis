## Project Goal:
Match the results of a test in [3] with our own NASTRAN simulation



## Test Case 3:

TODO: pick a test case and record which one here

Coordinate system: 
+x is direction of airflow (aero model requires this)
+z is along span of fin


## Structural Model🗼


- can use vectors to create fin shape in femap (or use solidworks/onshape as preferred)
- use CQUAD4 elements


## Aerodynamic Model ✈️
