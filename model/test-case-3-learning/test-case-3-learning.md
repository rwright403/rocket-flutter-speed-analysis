## Project Goal:
Match the results of a test in [3] with our own NASTRAN simulation



## Test Case 3:

TODO: pick a test case and record which one here

Coordinate system: 
+x is direction of airflow (aero model requires this)
+z is along span of fin

Fin dimensions and test info: 
Wind tunnel test machs: 1.519 - 4.14
Fin material: Magnesium
Fin foot material: Aluminum alloy

Model-75:
    Root chord: 202.5 mm
    Tip chord: 127.5 mm
    Span: 165 mm
    Bevel length: 1.73 mm
    Thickness: 2mm
    Leading & trailing edge bevel angle: 60¬∞
    Plate aspect ratio (longest side length/shortest side length): 1.0
    Taper ratio: 0.63
    Panel aspect ratio (semi-span^2/panel area): 1.0
    Fin foot span: 25 mm



## Structural Modelüóº


- can use vectors to create fin shape in femap (or use solidworks/onshape as preferred)
- use CQUAD4 elements
